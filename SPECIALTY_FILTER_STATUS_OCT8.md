## ‚ö†Ô∏è WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE NEXT:

### Critical Issue:
**The dashboard has HARDCODED doctors** (Dr. Castillo Rodriguez, Ana Martinez, etc.) that don't exist in the real database. The specialty filter won't work because:
1. The hardcoded doctors don't have specialty information
2. The filter JavaScript needs to match against real doctor data

### Solution Path A (Recommended - Dynamic Loading):
1. Update dashboard to load doctors from API (`/api/get-doctors.php`)
2. Generate provider columns dynamically based on API data
3. Filter function works automatically with loaded data

### Solution Path B (Quick Fix - Add Data Attributes):
1. Add `data-specialty=""` attributes to each hardcoded provider column
2. Update filter JavaScript to check data attributes
3. Later migrate to dynamic loading

## üìä DATABASE STATUS:

### Doctor Statistics:
- Total Real Doctors: **83**
- Specialties: **34 unique**
- Database: `centro_medico_universal.doctores`

### API Endpoint Available:
- URL: `/api/get-doctors.php`
- Returns: JSON with all doctors and their specialties
- Status: ‚úÖ Working

## üéØ RECOMMENDATION:

**Complete the dynamic loading approach** in segments:

**Segment 12:** Create JavaScript to load doctors from API
**Segment 13:** Generate provider columns from API data  
**Segment 14:** Connect specialty filter to work with dynamic data
**Segment 15:** Test and verify filter functionality
**Segment 16:** Deploy to server

This ensures the dashboard shows REAL doctors from the database and the specialty filter works correctly.

## üìÅ FILES MODIFIED TODAY:
- `/var/www/html/dashboard.html` - Added specialty filter dropdown and JavaScript
- Created backup: `/var/www/html/dashboard.html.bkp-specialty`
- Database: Created and populated `centro_medico_universal.doctores` table

---

**Status:** ‚úÖ Foundation complete, ready for dynamic loading implementation
**Next Step:** Implement dynamic doctor loading from API (Segment 12)
